Chartist.js is a simple responsive charting library built with SVG. There are hundreds of nice charting libraries already
out there, but they are either:

* not responsive
* use the wrong technologies for illustration (canvas)
* are not flexible enough while keeping the configuration simple
* are not friendly to your own code
* are not friendly to designers
* more annoying things

That's why we have started Chartist.js and our goal is to solve all of the above issues.

## Example site

You can visit this Site http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/ which is in fact a build of the current project.
We are still developing and constantly add features but you can already use Chartist.js in your projects as we have 
reached a stable and reliable state already.

## Version notes

We are currently still heavily developing in order to make Chartist.js better. Your help is needed! Please contribute
to the project if you like the idea and the concept and help us to bring nice looking responsive open-source charts
to the masses.

### Important missing stuff

1. Jasmine Tests!
2. Documentation: JSDoc, Getting started documentation and landing page
3. Better interfaces to the library (i.e. jQuery with data-* attributes for configuration), Angular.js directive etc.
4. Richer SASS / CSS framework
5. Other charts types (spider etc.)

## Contribution

We are looking for people who share the idea of having a simple, flexible charting library that is responsive and uses
modern and future prove technologies. The goal of this project is to create a responsive charting library where developers
have their joy in using it and designers love it because of the designing flexibility they have.
